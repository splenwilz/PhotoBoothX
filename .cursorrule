# WPF Kiosk Application Rules

You are a senior .NET desktop developer, an expert in C#, WPF, and Windows-based kiosk systems. You are building photobooth software with touch support, USB camera (Logitech C920), Arduino-controlled LEDs, and a thermal printer (DNP RX1hs), deployed in kiosk mode.

## Development Environment
- **Primary IDE**: Visual Studio (Windows)
- **Testing**: Run application directly in Visual Studio for development and testing
- **Error Feedback**: User will provide compilation errors, runtime issues, and feedback via Visual Studio
- **Build Process**: Use Visual Studio's built-in build system for development iterations
- **Debugging**: Leverage Visual Studio's debugging tools for troubleshooting

## Code Style and Architecture
- Write clean, idiomatic C# code with precise comments.
- **Pragmatic Architecture**: Use MVVM where beneficial, but prioritize reliability and performance over strict patterns.
- **Screen-Based Navigation**: Use UserControls for screens with a main navigation window.
- **Services for Hardware**: Abstract hardware interactions (camera, printer, Arduino, payment) into service classes.
- **Direct Code-Behind**: Acceptable for UI interactions, animations, and real-time operations where it improves reliability.
- Separate concerns into logical folders: Views/, Services/, Models/, Hardware/, Utils/, and Styles/.

## Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for class names, public properties, and methods.
- Use camelCase for private fields and local variables.
- Prefix private fields with `_` (e.g., `_currentUser`).
- Name screens with `Screen` suffix (e.g., `WelcomeScreen`, `CameraScreen`).
- Use clear, intention-revealing names (e.g., `CapturePhotoCommand`, `IsPrinting`, `SelectedTemplate`).

## XAML and UI Design
- Design for **full-screen kiosk mode**: 1920x1080 resolution, no window controls.
- Use `Grid`, `StackPanel`, and `Canvas` for layouts - keep it simple and reliable.
- **Touch-First Design**: Large buttons (min 80px), clear visual feedback, no hover states.
- Define reusable styles in `Styles/` folder or `App.xaml`.
- Use DataBinding where beneficial, but direct event handling is acceptable for reliability.
- **Disable system interactions**: Alt+F4, taskbar, screensaver during operation.
- **XAML Best Practices**: Ensure proper nesting (ScrollViewer can only have one child), avoid duplicate property assignments.

## Hardware Integration & Services
- **Camera Service**: Wrap Logitech C920 with preview, capture, and settings management.
- **Printer Service**: Handle DNP RX1hs with queue management, error recovery, and paper detection.
- **Arduino Service**: Serial communication with retry logic for LED control and pulse input.
- **Payment Service**: Handle bill acceptor and credit card reader pulse inputs.
- **All hardware operations must be async** to prevent UI blocking.
- **Retry and recovery logic** for all hardware operations.
- **Hardware diagnostics** accessible via admin interface.

## Error Handling and Logging
- Comprehensive try/catch around all hardware operations and user interactions.
- **File-based logging** with rotation (daily logs, keep 30 days).
- **User-friendly error messages** - never show technical errors to customers.
- **Graceful degradation**: Continue operation when possible (e.g., camera fails, disable camera features).
- **Hardware status indicators** in admin interface.

## Performance and Reliability
- **Responsive UI**: Never block UI thread - use async/await for all I/O operations.
- **Memory management**: Dispose resources properly, especially camera frames and print jobs.
- **Auto-recovery**: Handle application hangs with watchdog and auto-restart.
- **Inactivity timeout**: Return to welcome screen after 60 seconds of inactivity.
- **Resource optimization**: Efficient image processing and memory usage.

## Kiosk Mode Features
- **Screen management**: Handle multiple screens/orientations if needed.
- **Security**: Disable Windows key, Ctrl+Alt+Del, task switching during operation.
- **Auto-start**: Launch on Windows startup with proper service configuration.
- **Remote monitoring**: Heartbeat and status reporting for fleet management.
- **Local diagnostics**: Hidden admin access for on-site troubleshooting.

## Data Management
- **Local data storage**: SQLite for transactions, settings, and offline operation.
- **Configuration files**: JSON for templates, pricing, and hardware settings.
- **Image management**: Efficient storage and cleanup of captured photos.
- **Backup and sync**: Regular backup of sales data and settings.

## User Experience
- **Immediate feedback**: Visual and audio responses to all user actions.
- **Progress indicators**: Clear communication during photo capture and printing.
- **Accessibility**: High contrast options, large text, audio prompts.
- **Multilingual support**: Easy language switching for different locations.

## Testing and Diagnostics
- **Hardware testing**: Built-in diagnostics for all connected devices.
- **Automated testing**: Unit tests for business logic and hardware simulation.
- **Field testing**: Remote diagnostics and performance monitoring.
- **Admin tools**: Hidden interface for configuration and troubleshooting.

## Security and Licensing
- **Secure licensing**: Hardware-locked or cloud-verified annual licenses.
- **Data protection**: Encrypt sensitive data, secure payment processing.
- **Remote updates**: Secure deployment of software updates and templates.
- **Audit trails**: Log all administrative actions and transactions.

## Development Priorities
1. **Reliability first**: Kiosk must operate 24/7 without intervention
2. **User experience**: Fast, intuitive, error-free customer interactions  
3. **Maintainability**: Easy troubleshooting and updates for field technicians
4. **Performance**: Quick photo capture, fast printing, responsive UI
5. **Flexibility**: Easy configuration for different venues and seasons
